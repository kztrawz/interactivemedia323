	<p>A lexicon of words that were not</p>
	<p>said in childhood, and all of those</p>
	<p>that were, were said beside</p>
	<p>and upturned boat, lapped</p>
	<p>planking of the creosoted shed,</p>
	<p>were said into the wind on</p>
	<p>tussocky groundm by farm-rust vehicles.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>The buildings I could not complete</p>
	<p>without my father's help, the wind</p>
	<p>in which I was at sea.  Rain blooming</p>
	<p>in August that moved the land</p>
	<p>and over land toward the autumn,</p>
	<p>sliding through the gates of summer,</p>
	<p>feeling for the bone inside the wrist.</p>
