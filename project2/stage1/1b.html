	<p>&nbsp&nbsp Divide &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp year &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp into &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp seasons, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp four,</p>

<br>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp subtract &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp snow &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp then,</p>
<br>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp add   some  more  green,  a bud, a breeze, a whispering behind the trees</p>

<br>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp and here beneath the rain-scrubbed sky orange poppies multiply.</p>
