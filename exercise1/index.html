  <h1>How to hold your pee when you can't use the bathroom</h1>

  <p>Having to hold in urine(pee) may be difficult and can be unpleasant.  If you find yourself without acceptable facilities, privacy, time, or opportunity, there are some techniques you can try.  The steps listed under "Holding in Urine are techniques you can try when faced with having to hold in urine.  These are only a set of suggestions and are not supported by scientific studies.  Some, all, or none of them may work for you at different times.  Those steps are listed underneath "Training your bladder" are supported by scientific studies and will help if you can plan ahead.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><h2>Step 1: Create a Disaster Preparedness Plan for your house or place of work.</h2></li>
    	<ol>
    		<li><strong>Visualize closing your urethra.</strong>Your urethra is the opening to the outside through which urine exits your body.  Imagine squeezing muscles surrounding the urethra while allowing your other muscles to relax.  These are the same muscle you would squeeze if you were trying to stop a stream of urine.  Relax the pelvis and abdomen to avoid placing additional pressure on the bladder.  tensing unnecessary muscles can waste effort and may make the problem worse.</li>
    		<li><strong>Reposition your body.</strong>You may have to do this several times while holding in urine.  Different positions can relieve some of the pressure on your bladder, making it easier to hold in urine.  Consider this:</li>
    			<ul>
    				<li>Dont press on the lower part of your abdomen.  It will put more pressure on your bladder</li>
    				<li>Cross your legs when standing.  When standing, crossing your legs may help you hold in urine by compressing the urethra and surrounding areas.  It can help you feel like you're closing off your urethra.</li>
    				<li>Try crossing or uncrossing your legs while sitting down.  These changes in position can alleviate pressure on the bladder</li>
    				<li>Sit upright but relaxed.  Raise your upper body and allow your back to arch, taking pressure off your bladder, but do not stretch your abdomen as this my put pressure on your bladder.  Relax your abdomen.</li>
    				<li>Do not lean forward, pull the front of your pelvis up, or squeeze your abdomen inward.</li>
    			</ul>
    		<li><strong>Pass gass, if you have to.</strong>The buildup of gas in your intestines can place pressure on your bladder.  Alleviating this pressure by pressing gas may make you feel more comfortable and may allow you to hold in urine longer.</li>
    		<li><strong>Stay warm.</strong>Make yourself as warm as you can by covering up with blankets, turning up the heater, or curling your body closer together.  There is a phenomenon callled cold diuresis, wherein acute exposure to the cold causes an urge to urinate.</li>	
    		<li><strong>Avoid jarring or shaking your body.</strong>This can put pressure on your bladder and make you uncomfortable.</li>
    			<ul>
    				<li>Stay sitting, if sitting.  Too much movement can jar your bladder and make you uncomfortable.  If you find yourself in a comfortable position, stay there until it becomes uncomfortable and you need to reposition yourself.</li>
    				<li>Avoid changing positions too suddenly, and tense, abrupt, or sudden movement.</li>
    				<li>Keep movements as fluid and graceful as possible when you walk or perform other activities.</li>
    			</ul>
    		<li><strong>Avoid thinking of water, waterfalls, or rain.</strong>Friends may think it's hilarious to describe waterfalls, rivers, and other bodies of moving water - as well as flushing toilets - when they have been told you need to go.  Speak calmly and firmly.  Show no signs that their efforts are getting to you.  If they continue, calmly remove yourself from the area.  If this is not possible, plug your ears and loudly hum while closing your eyes.  If you should not close your eyes or do not wish to plug your ears, just hum as loud as you can.  Turn away from your friends to show them you will not communicate with them unless they stop</li>
